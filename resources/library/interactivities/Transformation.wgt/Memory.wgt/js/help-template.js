<h3>Memory</h3>
<h4>Mental calculation, matching game</h4>
<p>The goal of the App Memory is to make pairs and remembering the location of the various cards.</p>
<p>Cards are laid out in a grid face down. The player turns two cards. If the two cards match, cards are not covered. If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.</p>
<p>The game is over when all pairs have been found.</p>

<p>The "Edit" button allows you to :</p>
<ul>
	<li>change the theme of the App : tablet, slate, or none (by default tablet), </li>
	<li>choose the number of cards (4, 6 or 8 cards),</li>
	<li>select the displayed time of returned cards,</li>
	<li>edit directly a card.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cards have by default a text field. To insert text, click on it.</p>
<p>To add an image from your library, select the checkbox "use image" and drag and drop the item. You need to turn the card with the blue button before.</p>
<p>The cards are arranged randomly in the game mode.</p>								
<p>The App is able to identify the equivalent mathematical entries (authorized signs: "+", "*", "-", "/" and parentheses). However avoid division by 0.</p>
